# socialschool-app
The app for a social media platform for students.
## Deployment
### Note: Before you can use the app, you will have to deploy the server [socialschool-server](https://github.com/karastift/socialschool-server.git).
(Optional) I would recommend to store the app and the server in the same folder:
```bash
    mkdir socialschool && cd socialschool/
```
Clone the forked repository from GitHub:
```bash
    git clone https://github.com/{your username}/socialschool-app.git app
```
Install the dependencies:
```bash
    yarn
```
You should be ready to run the app with expo now:
```bash
    yarn start
```
